corrected = "last ride, right after you made a mistake by wearing a detector coat on a Friday, that was highly problematic in the world's most popular jobiscrit framework next tray was hit by a critical nine-point exploit once curtery advisory. The exploit allows an attacker to bypass authentication and authorization and extract midleware, which is really bad, like if you have software as a service product, normally you would have coding your bid aware that says something like 'if you don't pay yet, redirect a pricing page', but apparently Bursel, the company behind Extrias has been putting it on security hold recently because hackers can just say no thank you to any checks and use yours without pain. This mistake led to a massive elaboration of my next jasin reactors, who are currently screaming 'I told you so' for months in the basement and even big public companies like Cloudflare or using this as an opportunity to coach their customers themselves, leaving some gloryhound tech bro drama on Twitter that, but the most important thing now is that if currently have a next trace up in production that is not been upgraded, you could be in serious danger. This is so intimidating will find out how scared you really are and learn how the worst next tra exploit actually works. It is marked twenty-fourth when he twent his men who were watching the coast, who but did not actually get pass until March eighteenth, and as just way to wrong for an issue, that's not very hard effects, with its money that the seay of Cloudflare used this as an opportunity to promote their new tool that can take over Extrias on Cloudflare, claiming that unlike Bursel, they actually cared about your security but the seay of Bursel would not let his aggression stand, he pointed out how Plad Flare was responsible for cloud bleed, one of the worst security disasters of all time, and also said their ded opsition as trash naturally. The Cloudflarcy ye responded with a mean, and the whole incident was just childish around. I have been a happy customer of both Fore Sel and Cloudflare and wish we had living a world where all terrors got along that but may be a more realistic solution is to use a drawm a freenic server from a provider like Hostinger, the sponsor of this video, not only do they provide fully managed host in solutions, but also virtual private servers, where you can deploy anything, including frameworks like Next Day as if for under ten bucks promot, you could be running your own server with predictable pricing and a respectable to sea use. If looking for freedom and an autonomous developer experience, check out Hostinger with the wink below, this will see you in the next one lemme."

corrected = "Last rightday, Rit oufte you made a mistake of pointing your code on a Friday at the world's most popular jal Tescript framework next, yes was hacked by a critical nine point once curiosity and visibility, the exploit allowed an attacker to bypass authentication in alterization in Nextrias mitwherever, which is really bad. Like if you have a site where service broker normally you'd have code in your middlewhere that says something like 'if you now pay me yet', redirect a pricing page soon but apparently reselle the company behind nextry as has been biting at security locket recently because attacker can just say no thank you to any objects and users up without pass this mistake is led to a mass-liberation among Nextje actors who were currently screaming 'it's too soon from momspacement', even big culbacompanies like Cloudflare or usinghis as not an opportunity to poach customers from herself leading to some glorious tech drama and twitter trouble. But the most important thing now is that currently, you have a Nextri as app production, if that isn't upgraded, you could be in serious danger. So we will find out house crewd you rely are and learn how the worst Next as security flobl works. What scary about it is at it's a very easy exploit to pull off and of your weapons it uses for authentication, it could do some serious damage. Though but the issue also created some collateral damage like Cloudflare tried to place a rule to automatically block external use of this header, but then they had to go back and make that opt an only in because it was causing false positives with third party providers like Sepa as. Now older this bug really bad, most people aren't upset about the bug itself, but rather the amount of time it took to fix, it was first reported to the Nextrias team on February 20, who didn't actually get passed until March 10 and as is way too often for an issue the severe that isn't very hard to fix. What's mysterious is that the seio of Cloudflare used this as an opportunity to doubt their new tool they can take over Next as project and automate on Cloudflare, claiming that unlike herself, they actually care about your security. But the siteoverseer would not let his aggression stand, he pointed out how Cloudflare was responsible for cloud bleed one of the worse security disasters of all time, and also said their dead-protection as trash naturally the Cloudflare sela responded with a mean and the whole interaction was yis criminal around. I have been a happy customer of Bolt portals and Cloudflare and wish we could live in a world were all tech giants behave, that but may be a more realistic solution is to use a dream a free VPS from my provider like Hostinger, that'sponser of today video, not only did Ay provide fully managed hosting solutions by also virtual private servers where you can deploy anything including framework like Next je as of here under ten bucks per month, you could run your own server with predictable pricing and a respectable two second response time and eight CGBits of RAM. In fact when Ho creae a server, you can automate the configuration with tools like wolfy, which makes it possible to house Nextray as on your own vepyes with minimal pain, if you're looking for freedom and an all-round experience check out Hostinger with the winkblelow doesist wen the co epor o thanks e watchingan an a tha wil sinyou in English."
