00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,439
Last weak i put up this video about solling the game word oll,

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,920
or lest trying to solfe it,

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,420
using information tho,

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,820
and i wanted to ata quick,

5
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,900
a what you becallus and adendom,

6
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,819
a confessiono basically,

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,080
id just one explaine a place where by made a istake.

8
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,919
E turned out, there was iing slate bug in the coat that i was running two recreate wortl

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,080
in then bron al of the outer thems tissovit and test their performance,

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,640
and is one of those bugs that effects every small prersentade of cases,

11
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,099
so hey was easy to miss,

12
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,819
and it has only very slight effect that for the most part dosn early matter basically it

13
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,460
had to do with how you assin a color to a guess that has multan differet letters in it.

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,660
Reseptleith you guess speed and the truancser is abide,

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,380
how should you color those two ease from the gues,

16
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,739
will a wa that it works with the wortl conventions is that the first ea would be colored

17
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,380
yellow, and the second one would be colored gray.

18
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,680
You mi think of that first one is matching up with something from the true answer,

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,359
and the greenness as telling you,

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,880
there is no second e,

21
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,740
by contrast, if the answer was something liked inrace,

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,120
both of those ease would be coloer gillow,

23
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,920
helling you that there is a first e in indifferent location,

24
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,498
and there s a second e,

25
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:06,819
also in a different location,

26
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:09,779
the morely if one of the ease hits and its green,

27
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:15,039
then that second one would be gray in the case were the true answer has no second nen,

28
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,578
but it would be yellow in the case where there is a second e,

29
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,359
and it s jist in a diffeet mocation one stoicshwoard,

30
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:25,939
somewore along the way i axtently introduced behavior that differs from these convention

31
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,819
slightly. Nhonesly, it was really dumb,

32
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,218
bey sicly at some point in the middle of the project,

33
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:33,179
i ont an two speed up some of the computations,

34
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:37,618
and a strang a little trick for how computed the value for this pattering between any

35
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:38,699
given pair of words,

36
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,158
and you noi disdintreally think it through,

37
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,879
and it introduce the slight change.

38
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:44,978
The aronic part is it in the end,

39
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,858
the actual way to make things fastist is to precebute all those patterns d so tit

40
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,298
everything is dist a look up,

41
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:52,778
and so it wouldn t matter how long a takes to do each one,

42
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,999
especially a fe rating hard toread buggy coad to make it happen.

43
00:01:56,339 --> 00:01:57,419
En are you live an elarn.

44
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,218
Mi hars how this effects,

45
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,459
the actual video, in very little of substance realy changes,

46
00:02:02,699 --> 00:02:06,278
of course the mai lessons about what is information what is entripe all that s das the

47
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:10,778
same, every now ind them if hem showing on screen some distribution associated with ta

48
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:15,218
given word, that distribution might actually be a little bet off because some of the

49
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:19,598
buckets assucied woith batharious patterns should include either more or fewer,

50
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,018
true answers, even then it as a grealy come upcus as veryrare that i would be showing a

51
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:27,099
word that had munbl letters that also hit this edge case,

52
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:31,039
by orne of the very futhings of substance that does change,

53
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:36,018
and that arguably does manner a fair bit was the final conclision around how if we want

54
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:39,999
to find the optimal possible score for the wordl answerliss,

55
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,899
what open and guessed to such an olger the muse in the video,

56
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,079
i said the best performance that i confined came from opening with the word crane,

57
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,998
which was trew only in the sinte that the outer thems were playing a very slightly

58
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:53,978
different game. After fixing it,

59
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:55,099
and we running at all,

60
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:59,278
there is a different answer for what thef the aredically optimal first guess is for this

61
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,919
particular lift, an look,

62
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:07,178
i know tit you know that the point of te video is not to find some technically optimal

63
00:03:07,179 --> 00:03:09,319
answer to some random on lane game.

64
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:13,498
The point of the video is deshamelessly hop on the bandwagon of an internet trind

65
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:16,098
tosneaek attack people with an information thery lesson.

66
00:03:16,478 --> 00:03:18,298
A at a good, i stand by that pert,

67
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:19,697
but i nowhow the ininat works,

68
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:24,277
and for lot a people to one mayne take away was what is the best opener for the gave

69
00:03:24,278 --> 00:03:25,977
wordl, and i get it,

70
00:03:25,978 --> 00:03:28,318
i walked into that cas the puttit in that them now,

71
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:31,798
but presondly you can forgive me if i want ad a little correction here,

72
00:03:32,018 --> 00:03:35,098
and a more meaning for reason to circle back to all this ecurally,

73
00:03:35,378 --> 00:03:38,358
i that i never belly packed about what went i into that final analysis,

74
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:42,358
tan its intresting as a sublesson in it own right sopniths worth dowing here.

75
00:03:43,138 --> 00:03:47,517
No if you'll recall most of our time last video was spent on the challenge of trying to

76
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,198
rate an olger them to solv wordol,

77
00:03:49,278 --> 00:03:52,578
thit did not use the official list of all possible answers,

78
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:56,158
an i taste that feels a bit like overfitting to attest set,

79
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,598
and with morefine is building something bet s rasiliant.

80
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:02,837
This is why we went through the whole process of looking at relative word frequencies in

81
00:04:02,838 --> 00:04:07,497
the english language to come up at some notion of how likely each on willict be toul be

82
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:08,958
included as a final anser.

83
00:04:09,338 --> 00:04:11,198
However, bor what were doing here,

84
00:04:11,298 --> 00:04:14,318
where weld dutrying to find an absolute best performance period,

85
00:04:14,638 --> 00:04:19,198
i am inquorperating that official list and jus shame wasle overfitting to the test tat,

86
00:04:19,338 --> 00:04:22,818
which is to say, we know with certainty whether a word as included or not,

87
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:25,638
and we can assigne a uniform probability to each one.

88
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,738
If you remember, the firt step ind all ofthis was to sai for a particular open and guess,

89
00:04:30,878 --> 00:04:32,878
ay bo something like my old favourte cran,

90
00:04:33,058 --> 00:04:36,258
po lingkly is it that you would see each of the possible patterns,

91
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:40,658
and in this context where we are shamelessly overfitting to the wordl answer list,

92
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:44,058
all that involvse is counting how many of the possible answers,

93
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:45,478
give euth one of these pats,

94
00:04:45,998 --> 00:04:49,737
and then of course most of our time was peent on this canefany looking formula to

95
00:04:49,738 --> 00:04:52,958
quantify the ament of information that you had get from this guess.

96
00:04:53,318 --> 00:04:57,117
The basically involvse going through ech tont of those buckets and saying how much

97
00:04:57,118 --> 00:04:58,518
information would you gain.

98
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:02,997
Tit has this log expression that is af fanciful way of saying how many times whould you

99
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:06,978
cut your space of possibilities in half if you observe to given pattern.

100
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:09,538
We take a waited average of all of those,

101
00:05:09,798 --> 00:05:13,418
and it gives this amesure of how much we expects tolern from this first gess,

102
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:15,177
in a moment will go deeper than this,

103
00:05:15,178 --> 00:05:18,997
but if he simply search through all thirteen thousand different words thay you could

104
00:05:18,998 --> 00:05:22,378
start with, and you asked which one has the highest expected information,

105
00:05:23,058 --> 00:05:26,417
etturnes out, the best possible answer is sore,

106
00:05:26,897 --> 00:05:28,737
which does t really look like a real word,

107
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:33,257
but i guessot an obsolete term for a baby hack,

108
00:05:34,057 --> 00:05:36,337
the top sifteen openers by this metric,

109
00:05:36,577 --> 00:05:37,757
apendto look like tis,

110
00:05:38,177 --> 00:05:39,257
but these are not necessarily,

111
00:05:39,697 --> 00:05:40,937
the best open ind guesses,

112
00:05:41,097 --> 00:05:44,977
because their only looking one step in with tha heristic of expected information,

113
00:05:45,497 --> 00:05:47,717
the try to estimate what the two score will be,

114
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:49,277
but there s few enough patterns,

115
00:05:49,357 --> 00:05:51,897
that we can do an exast of search two steps in,

116
00:05:52,197 --> 00:05:54,317
resemble letsar you opened with sore,

117
00:05:54,657 --> 00:05:59,076
and the pattern he happened a sea was temos likely one all grays then he can run

118
00:05:59,077 --> 00:06:01,077
identical an lysis from that quint,

119
00:06:01,217 --> 00:06:03,136
for a given proposed second guess,

120
00:06:03,137 --> 00:06:04,297
something like kity,

121
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:08,577
what s the distribution across all patterns in that restricted case where were restricted

122
00:06:08,657 --> 00:06:11,417
only to the words that would produce all grays for sore,

123
00:06:11,757 --> 00:06:15,857
and then we measure the flatness of that distribution musing this te expected information

124
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:20,776
formila, and we do that for all thirteen thousand possible words that we could use as a

125
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:25,277
second guess, douing this we can find the opotible second guess in that scenario,

126
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:28,537
and the amount of information we ware expected to get from it,

127
00:06:28,837 --> 00:06:32,736
and if wee washerancs and repeat and do this for all of the different possible pattens

128
00:06:32,737 --> 00:06:37,537
that you might see, we get a full map of all the best possible second guesses together

129
00:06:37,557 --> 00:06:45,996
with thexpected information of each e arn from there if you take a waited average of all

130
00:06:45,997 --> 00:06:50,737
thee seconstep values weaded according to held likely you are to fall into that bucket.

131
00:06:50,997 --> 00:06:52,857
They gives you a measure of how much information,

132
00:06:53,017 --> 00:06:58,616
youre likely to gain from the guess sore after the second step when we use this two stepp

133
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:00,277
metric as our new means of ranking.

134
00:07:00,597 --> 00:07:02,036
The list gets jacon up abit,

135
00:07:02,037 --> 00:07:04,957
sor is no longer first place it fals back to fourteenth,

136
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:07,777
e instead what rises to the top is slanagain,

137
00:07:09,277 --> 00:07:12,777
does t feel very real i am it looked like yit his at,

138
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:14,917
british carm for a speed.

139
00:07:15,137 --> 00:07:16,617
Tit s used for cutting tush,

140
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:22,476
at, but as i can see it is of really tight race among all of hese top contenders sburt

141
00:07:22,477 --> 00:07:25,137
who gains the most information after those toekh steps,

142
00:07:25,657 --> 00:07:28,917
and even still these ar not necessarily the best open and guesses,

143
00:07:29,237 --> 00:07:33,076
because information is just the heristic it s not telling as the actual score if you

144
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,236
actually play the game.

145
00:07:34,576 --> 00:07:39,435
What i did as i ran the sibulation of playing all two thousand te underd fifteen possible

146
00:07:39,436 --> 00:07:44,696
wortl games with all possible answers on the top two hundred fifty from this list,

147
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,856
then by doing this seeing how they actually perform,

148
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:52,896
the one that ins up very margnaltly with the best possible score,

149
00:07:53,336 --> 00:08:03,336
on that to be sale, which is lit s e sale an alternate spelling for salla,

150
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:06,196
which is a lats maeval helmets.

151
00:08:07,016 --> 00:08:10,255
As, if that feels little to to fakh for yout,

152
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,436
which it does for me,

153
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:15,796
wiut be happy to know that trace and creat div almost andintical performance,

154
00:08:16,356 --> 00:08:19,436
each of them has the benefit of obviously being orea word,

155
00:08:19,636 --> 00:08:23,675
so there is one day when you get it right on the first guess sance both our actual wordl

156
00:08:23,676 --> 00:08:28,855
answers. This move from sorting bist on the best two step intrepeas to sworting bist on

157
00:08:28,856 --> 00:08:30,216
thelowest avearad score,

158
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:32,676
also sheexep the list but not nearly as much,

159
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:36,616
for exemple, sale was previously third place before a bubles to the top,

160
00:08:36,836 --> 00:08:39,236
and creat and trace were both forth and fifth.

161
00:08:39,676 --> 00:08:43,175
If your curious, you can t get slightly better performance from here by doing a little

162
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:47,556
brote forcing. This arynice block tous by joneth and olson if you curious about this,

163
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:51,415
where he also that s you explore what the opotimale following guesses are fer a few of

164
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:56,275
distorting word based on these optomol elgar thems stepping back from all this,

165
00:08:56,276 --> 00:09:01,655
though andtold by some people that at clot ruins the game to over aniline it like this

166
00:09:01,656 --> 00:09:03,876
and try to find an optimal ok an a guess.

167
00:09:04,276 --> 00:09:07,895
Not feels canna dirty if you huse that open ing guess after learning it,

168
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:09,815
and if yeel inefficient if you don t,

169
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:14,135
b the thing is, i don t actually think this is the best opener forar human playing the

170
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:18,635
game, foon thing, you would bee to know what the optimal second guess is fre eacht one of

171
00:09:18,636 --> 00:09:19,876
the pardons that you see,

172
00:09:20,316 --> 00:09:25,035
a more importantly all of this isi t a setting where we are absuredly overfit to the

173
00:09:25,036 --> 00:09:26,296
official wirl answerless,

174
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:31,336
the moment it sayd the ne ork tines choeses to change what that list is under the hood,

175
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:33,096
all of this would go out the window,

176
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:35,295
beway that we humans play the game.

177
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:37,796
Is just very different from what any of these ouger hand sirdoing.

178
00:09:38,056 --> 00:09:41,316
We don t have the worthlest memorized were not doing exast of searches,

179
00:09:41,636 --> 00:09:45,235
we have ientuithion from things like what are the vocals and how wher they placed.

180
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:48,475
I would actually be most happy if those af you watching this midio,

181
00:09:48,615 --> 00:09:52,575
pumply forgot what happens to be the technically best opening guess,

182
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:56,974
and instead came out remembering things like how do you quant to fy information ore the

183
00:09:56,975 --> 00:09:59,575
fact that you should look out for when a greedy outwe them,

184
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:03,275
fal short of the glibly best performance that you a get from a eper search,

185
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:07,295
to my tast at least the joy of writing outwer thems to try to ple games,

186
00:10:07,395 --> 00:10:11,015
acuias very little bearing on how i like to play those games as a human,

187
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:15,074
the point of riting ougerthams fr al this is not to effect the way that we played the

188
00:10:15,075 --> 00:10:17,055
game, and still dus to fundwart gam.

189
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:20,755
It s te hone in our muscles for writing out wer thems an more meeting ful context
