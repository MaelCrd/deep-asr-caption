00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:06,340
Lu moe the phrase exponential groath is familiar to most people,

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,619
and yet human intuition has a hard time really recondizing what it mean,

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,220
sometimes we can anchor on assequence a small seming numbers and then become surprised

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,000
ben suddenly those number s looked big,

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,600
even if, the overall trend follows and exponential perfectly consistend mit.

6
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,300
This rechere is the daterfor the recorded cases oof covid nineteen,

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,120
aca a the coron ofvirous,

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,139
lelishe at the time that im writing this never one to wast an opportunity for a

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,599
matlesson, i thet this might be good time for all of us to go back to the basix on whan

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,220
exponential groth really is where it comes trom what id implies,

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,700
and lay be most pressingly how to know when it s coming to an end,

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,219
exponential growth means that as you go from one day to the next in evals multiplying by

13
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,260
some constant in aurdata,

14
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,239
the number of tases in each day tense to be a multble of about one point on five to one

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,560
ting two five of the number of cleaves the previous day,

16
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,260
navirices are a tex pook example of this candor groth,

17
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,060
because what causes new cases are the existent cases,

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,240
so if the number of cases on a given day is an,

19
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:17,899
and we say that each individual witthevirous is exposed to onaverage e people on a given

20
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,000
day, and each one of those exposures had the probability conn of decoming a new infection

21
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,840
than the number of new cases on a given day is etimes pe times an,

22
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,759
and the factoid, and itself is a factor in its own change is what really makes things go

23
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,160
fast, because if an gets big.

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,760
A means the rec of growth itself is getting big.

25
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,500
One we to think about this is that as you add the new cases to get the next day s count.

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,240
You can fact er out the en,

27
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,080
soits just the same is multiplying by some constant that s bigger than one.

28
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,880
This is sometimes easier to see if we put the wy exiss of egrafh on a ligwithmixcale,

29
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,940
which means that each step of a fix distance,

30
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,440
corsponstim bultepplying by a certain factor.

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,840
Mis case each step is another power of ten on the scale,

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,240
exponential growth should look like a straight line,

33
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,679
looking at ardata, it seems like it took twenty days to go from one hundred to one

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,080
thousand and thirteen days to go from that to ten thasand,

35
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,060
and if you do a thimble linnior regression to find the best fit line.

36
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,439
You coul look at the slope of that line to draw a conclusion like we cintimble teply by

37
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,960
ten every sixteen days on aperage,

38
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,599
this regression also that this belittle more quantitative about exactly how close the

39
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,220
expinetial fit really is,

40
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,720
and to use the technicl s statistical jargon here.

41
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,360
Answers that it s really freekinclips,

42
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,839
but i can be heart tod gi just exactly whath that means if true when you see one country

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,540
witsay six thousand cases,

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,940
and another with sixty.

45
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,319
It easy to think but the second as doing a hundredtimes better and hence fine,

46
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,239
but if your actually an asiuation were numbers multiply by ten every sixteen days,

47
00:02:56,499 --> 00:03:00,538
another way to view the same fact is that the second country is about a month behind the

48
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:02,618
ferst. A disis, of course,

49
00:03:02,619 --> 00:03:04,819
rather worrying if you dryw out the vine.

50
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,899
I m recording this on march six,

51
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:08,379
and if the presentran continues,

52
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:11,179
it would mean hiding million cases in thirty days,

53
00:03:11,339 --> 00:03:13,639
hitding ten billin in forty seven days,

54
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:15,839
a hundred million ind sixty four days,

55
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:18,619
and one lilian in eighty one days.

56
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,999
Met was to say, though you can t us driw out a line like this frever,

57
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,299
the clearly has to starts slowing down at semppy,

58
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,779
but the crucial question is win,

59
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:30,718
is it liked the sirs outbreak of two thousin two,

60
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,979
which kept out around eigh thousand cases or the spanish lee of nignteen eighteen,

61
00:03:35,059 --> 00:03:40,519
which ultimately infected about twenty seven persent of the world s population ingeneral

62
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,458
with no context just drawing a line throu your data is not a great way to make

63
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,059
predictions, but remember,

64
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,059
there s an actual beason to expect an exponential here.

65
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:53,519
If the number of new cases each day is proportional to the number of existing cases.

66
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,079
It necessarily means each day umol replied by some constant,

67
00:03:57,559 --> 00:04:01,899
some boving forward de days is the same as miltiploiingt by that constant te times,

68
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:05,319
the only way that stops as it either the number en,

69
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,079
or pe gos down. It s inevitable that this will eventually happen,

70
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,299
even in the most perfectly pernicious model for ofvirous,

71
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:15,058
which would be where every day,

72
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:19,319
each person with the infection is exposed to a rand om subset of the world population.

73
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,858
At some point most of the people theyre exposed to would aready be sick,

74
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:30,158
and so they could t become your casets in our ecuasion that would mean that the

75
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:34,478
probability of an exposure becoming a new infection would have to include some kine

76
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,058
effector to account for the probability that some one your exposed two is already

77
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:41,139
infected for a random shuffling midte likeness,

78
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,618
that could mean including factor like one miness,

79
00:04:43,619 --> 00:04:46,479
the proportion of people in the world who were already infected,

80
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:50,579
including that factor in inselving for how and grows.

81
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:53,579
You get whats known in the business as a logistic curve,

82
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:57,379
which is dessentually indistinguishable from an exponential at the beteening,

83
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:01,379
but ultimately at levels out once your approaching the total population sas,

84
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,819
which is what you would expect,

85
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:06,419
true expinentials dessentilly never existend the rea world,

86
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:11,558
every one of them is belyed the start of a legistin curv of this point rig care were that

87
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:16,199
logistic goes from crivving upward to insted curving downward is known as the inflection

88
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:19,979
point there the number of new cases each day,

89
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:22,059
represented by the slope of this curve,

90
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:26,499
stopps increasing, and instead tays roughly constant before starts decreason,

91
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:34,619
so one number, the people often follow with epademix is the groth factor,

92
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:38,759
which is difined as thracia between the number of new cases one day,

93
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:41,099
and the number of new cases the previous day,

94
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:46,718
so just to beclear if you were looking at all of the totals from one day to the next then

95
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:49,159
tracking te changes between those totals,

96
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:53,319
the grothfactor is a racial between two successive changes.

97
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,519
While youre on the exponential part,

98
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:00,119
this factor stays consistently above one.

99
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,938
Whereis a soon as your grothfactor look claser to one.

100
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:04,439
It s assign that you ve hit the inflection.

101
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,079
This can mike for another counter into it af fact while following the dava,

102
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:13,458
think abut what it would feel like for the number of new cases one day to be about ficten

103
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:16,839
percent more than the number of new cases the previous day,

104
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,819
and contrast that with what it would feo like for to be about the same,

105
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:22,478
just looking at the totals,

106
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,159
they resulted. They don t weally feel that different,

107
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:28,819
but if the grotfactor is one,

108
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,419
thet couol mean year the inflection point of aligistic,

109
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,998
which would mean the totl number of cases is gin a max out atd about two times wherever

110
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:40,958
you are now, but a grothfactor bigger than one settled that might seem means ere on the

111
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,518
exponential part, which could impli there are orders of magnitude of growth still waiting

112
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:52,778
a head of you. Nou whileit s true that in the worst tasituation the saturation poaint is

113
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:53,899
around the total population.

114
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:58,318
It s of course not at all true that people with te virous are rendon wah cheffled around

115
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,739
the worlds population likeness,

116
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:02,079
people are cluster to in local communities.

117
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:07,598
However, if you ren simulations fere this numen of little bid of travel between plusters

118
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:15,938
likeness. The growth is actually not that much different what you went up with is a kind

119
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:19,819
of fractal pattern were communities themselves sfunks and like individuals,

120
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:24,919
each one has some exposiour to others with some probability at spreading the infection,

121
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:35,379
said the same underlying and expenintu inducing the laws apply or moonelmormoor ol

122
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:47,258
fortunately, saturating the whole population is not the only thing they can cause the two

123
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,019
factors we care about to go down.

124
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:53,159
The mantal exposure can also go down when people stoppdgathering in travelling,

125
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,319
an the infectionary can go down when people just wash their handsmore.

126
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,859
The other thing that counterantuative about expinentiral broth,

127
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:04,439
thi time in a more optimistic sens is just houe sincitive it is to this constant,

128
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,839
for exemple, if it s fifteen percent like it is as ammrecorting this,

129
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:13,018
and were at twenty one thousand cases now that would mean tat sixty one days from now,

130
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:18,538
you had over a hundred milliam by if through a bit less exposure and infection that re

131
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,019
drops down to five per cent.

132
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:23,479
It do nit ean the projection also dropps down by factor of three,

133
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:26,079
tet equally dropps down to around four hundred thousand,

134
00:08:26,818 --> 00:08:30,338
so of people ar sufficiently worried than there s awatless to wory about,

135
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:54,658
but if no one is worried that s when you should woring e aole ano a one a.
